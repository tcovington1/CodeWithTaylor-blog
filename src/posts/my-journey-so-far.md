It's been awhile! So much has happened since my last post. In this post, I wanted to share my journey to becoming a Software Engineer.

That's right, since my last post I have been hired as an Associate Software Engineer at the finance company I've been with for 9 years (started in the mailroom at the age of 19). I can hardly believe it myself. I ask my wife to pinch me every day. Do I really get to code all day???

### Where I started

Before learning to code, I had never really been a "tech guy". I grew up playing video games and I've always enjoyed tech but I never really understood it or learned how it all worked.

In 2018 I wanted to start making money as a side hustle to my normal 9-5 job. Just something to get a little more income for the family. I've always loved business and entrepreneurship. My first adventure was selling t-shirts online. I started to design t-shirts so I needed a website next, right? As I started to learn how a website is created, **I found myself fascinated with building websites**.

In December 2018, I decided to take learning to code serious so I found a course on Udemy called *"[The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)"* by Colt Steele. If you want to check out this course, don't pay any more than $15 for it. Wait for a sale.

### Attending a bootcamp

For 6 months I studied how to program diligently. However, there was a lot of confusion and I had many unanswered questions.

* Where do I start? 
* Which languages do I learn first? 
* Why learn Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript?
* What's the difference between web and software development? 

One minute I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The next I was buying a $300 Python course! I ended up getting a refund because after talking with a friend and my wife, I figured this wasn't the route I wanted to go. I was confused. 

After looking back, I would have been fine going down either paths. The key is to think about what you want to create and stick to ONE path. It is okay to change paths, but don't keep changing paths or you won't get anywhere. Once you learn that path, it's easier to branch out and learn others. As a matter of fact, I'm currently writing Python code in my job today!

Anyway, I didn't feel like I could do this by myself. I made myself sick thinking if I should:

- a) Go back to college and get a degree
- b) Try a coding bootcamp

If you've read my previous posts you'll know that I also work full-time, have two young kids (ages 2 and 5), and I'm married. These humans count on me to be there and to provide. So time is limited.

I've never liked traditional school. I've always enjoyed learning by following my curiosity so college didn't appeal to me and going into debt didn't sound smart either. 

So this led to my decision to attend a part-time full-stack web developer bootcamp at DevPoint Labs here in Utah. I started in August 2019 and graduated at the end of October 2019. This decision was the best I'm made as was worth the $5,000 investment. 

During this bootcamp we learned ReactJS and Ruby on Rails to build full-stack applications. We worked in teams, pair programmed, and had the worst merge conflicts I've seen since :) but it taught me a lot.

### Looking for my shot
