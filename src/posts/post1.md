Hey there!

Thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to read my blog! I appreciate you.

Anyway, I know you're here to learn something and I wanted to start out by sharing a little about myself so you know the person behind all the words. First, I'm Taylor! I live in Salt Lake City, UT. Born and raised! I'm a husband, a father of two boys (ages 4 and 2), and I'm a [Latter-Day Saint](https://lds.org). Your can also [follow my journey on Twitter](https://twitter.com/codewithtaylor). I'm not much of a writer but I want to share my story in hopes that it can help anyone looking to get started in web development. 

##### What You Can Expect From This Blog

This blog is going to be a place where I share my experiences in web development, what I learn along the way, balancing life, business, etc. I'm hoping we can all learn from each other and I'd also love to hear from you along the way! You'll also learn more about me and my crazy life outside of coding!

Being a [#CodeNewbie](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CodeNewbie&src=typeahead_click) is hard, I know. I was very frustrated and still get frustrated with so much to know and learn. But hard is good! It's a challenge. I remember being told and reading that I needed to pick a path. Front-end, back-end, DevOps? How was a newbie supposed to decide when I had _no clue_ what anything was? It took a lot of time...and asking others. This blog will help you. There's so much to learn at first and it seems overwhelming. This blog series will give you the tools, resources, experiences and hopefully some fun that you need to get going and become successful. 

##### My Background

Currently I work in the finance and investing industry. The last 5 years I've been helping people save for retirement, college, and investing their money in stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, etc. I really enjoy helping people! But I've also grown a love for technology and building solutions for businesses. That's where my passion lies. 

I didn't grow up wanting to be a developer. I did love videos games though! My passion has always been in business and creating things. I remember when I was about 16 years old I read a book called *'Rich Dad Poor Dad' by Robert T. Kiyosaki * (if you haven't read it, I'd recommend it. You can find it [here](https://amzn.to/2Xksrfd)) and I was determined to work for myself. My dad always told me it was better to get a good job and get the benefits. But I was determined to do something else. Build a business...
