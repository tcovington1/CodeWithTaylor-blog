Ayo! 

Thank you for reading. I've decided I'm going to start round 2 of #100DaysOfCode from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codewithtaylor). If you are not familiar, check it out [here](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=typeahead_click). Twitter has a fantastic dev community. There are a ton of new people learning to code with you. You are not alone. When you struggle, there is someone out there struggling as well.

The first round I did of #100DaysOfCode was really successful. Check it out on my [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/codewithtaylor). I started it before I went into my dev bootcamp, and ended after I finished. It helped my stay accountable and sharing my progress. 

### \--- Goals ---

I'm going to post what I'm working on every day here in this blog. In these 100 days I want to:         

1. Blog and post my progress often         
2. Code and contribute to GitHub daily (obvious one)
3. Build build build - a goal of mine is to really push building full-stack app           and web sites without a tutorial. I want to get stuck, search the docs, and 
            fix it. I want to design in Sketch, then build it all the way through.
4. Work as a full-time developer. I'll be spending a lot of time interview            prepping, and hopefully interviewing!

So come back to it when you want to check in to see where I'm at.  A LOT can happen in 100 days, so come on this journey with me!
