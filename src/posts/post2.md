title: What I've Learned at a Coding Bootcamp
---
Hey there!

Thank you for reading my blog. I appreciate you!

I recently graduated from the **DevPoint Labs 11-week Part-Time Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp** and I wanted to share my experience and what to expect along the way. If you're like me, preparation is key in all things so I hope you find this post helpful!

Note: This post is pretty long so break it up into sections and come back to it!

### Before

Before I decided to go to a bootcamp I was teaching myself to code. I started about a year before, but it'd start and stop often when I felt discouraged or overwhelmed with having to choose a direction. There's so much information when you're getting started and it seems to keep changing. This still happens to me 2 years later!

Before you start at a bootcamp, the most important thing is to do your research on the camp you're going to. More and more nowadays there are bootcamps popping up, local and online.  I've heard a few stories about some camps getting you signed up, take your money, and don't fulfill their promises. So do some research. Here are a few sites that might help:

The next thing I'd recommend before getting started is to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript ( depending on what type of bootcamp you attend ). The bootcamp I went to have us pre-course study materials to learn these basics. This was super helpful even though I had already studied the basics. I still took 2 weeks on each to learn all that I could before I attended. The reason I think this is a must is because when I started day 1, they didn't teach these. It was expected that we know this already.

Also, don't worry about who else will be in the class or it you'll fit in. I attended bootcamp at the at of 28 and I thought I'd be older in the class. I soon found out that most of the people in my class were my age! 

Go into the program, however long it is, with the mindset that it's short-term and everything else will need to be put on hold. I say this for a few reasons:

1. You're paying for this
2. You want to get the most out of it
3.

I'd also recommend journalling your journey from the beginning. It's healthy to reflect on your experiences and write down your thoughts. I started journaling starting day 1 and I can now reflect on my worries fitting in and getting over my imposter syndrome. 

### During

During your bootcamp cohort there are many things to remember in addition to learning. Here's a few I'd like to point out: 

1. Study, Study, Study
2. Don't take the weekends off
3. Build projects
4. Network
5. Use the mentors around you
6. Keep journaling

First and foremost you need to STUDY, STUDY, STUDY. It's a short period of time in your life. Really put the time and effort into it. You may have the nights off... and weekends... but I'd recommend using this time to understand and restudy areas you don't feel as comfortable with. I will add that taking breaks is REALLY important so if you feel like your brain hurts and you need time away, take it! Just make sure you prioritize your time during your cohort.

There will be a lot to learn. I had been learning on my own for about 6-months prior to attending the bootcamp and the information overload was real! 

Anytime you're learning to code it's extremely important to build projects, big and/or small. During my DevPoint Labs cohort we were provided many projects for each language we learned. This was great and helped a ton! I'd also recommend making the projects your own, add YOU to it. Then make another project on your own. This will force you to solve the problems you run into. 

While you're learning to code, your bootcamp cohort will also provide other opportunities IF YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM. The first one I'd like to point out is creating a network. Your surrounded by other developers looking to get jobs in code, already working at a tech company, or they are teaching code! Create networks with the Teachers Assistants (TA), your teachers, the founders, and your cohort devs. 

I'd also recommend using the mentors around you. In my cohort the founders provided workshops for updating your resume, social media, and presentations with bootcamp graduates. I'd also pick the brains of the Teachers Assistant (TA) and 

network (TA, teachers, founders, co-devs) keep journaling

### After

Reach out to people you networked with  Dont get discouraged if you don't know everything when you leave
still journal
stay present in the slack channel
KEEP LEARNING
